Deployment (P1):

- [x] TODO(P1): Netlify SPA routing — add `public/_redirects` (or `netlify.toml`) so deep links like `/planner` don’t 404 in production

Income Details (Tracker) (P1):

- [x] TODO(P1): Tracker — income delete confirmation alert copy: don’t call it an “expense”, include the income source name, and fire success/error toast appropriately
- [x] TODO(P1): Tracker — updating/adding income sources should update “Monthly Income” total at top of card (currently only impacts “Actual Net Income” stat)
- [x] TODO(P1): Tracker — clarify stat bar layout above “<year> Summary”; fix duplicate “Total Saved” and “Leftover” stats (ensure intended count and uniqueness)

Savings Goals (Tracker) (P1):

- [x] TODO(P1): Tracker — savings goal edit: clicking “Edit” should only open the selected item (not all edit panels)
- [x] TODO(P1): Tracker — savings goal save: toast fires but changes are not persisted; fix persistence and refresh behavior
- [x] TODO(P1): Tracker — savings goal delete: toast fires but item is not removed; fix deletion and refresh behavior

Runtime console errors (P1):

- [x] TODO(P1): Tracker — fix duplicate React key warning `same key, NaN` from SavingsGoalsTracker list rendering (ensure stable, unique keys)
- [x] TODO(P1): Tracker — fix Chakra `Progress` error: value receives `[object Object],[object Object]` and exceeds max 100 (ensure numeric value and correct max)

  - Local dev instructions
  - Link to architecture docs (`docs/developer/README.md` and docs overview)
  - Mention `/samples` folder and sample CSVs
- [x] TODO(P1): Update CONTRIBUTING.md for Budgeteer
  - dev workflow, branches/PR expectations

  - conventions for dates/month keys, transaction strong keys
- [x] TODO(P1): Replace README banner with a Budgeteer version
  - new file: `docs/assets/readme-banner.svg`
  - ensure README references it
- [ ] TODO(P1): Ensure `/samples` is documented and curated
  - describe each sample file
  - keep a small, deterministic “golden” CSV for ingestion tests/debug
- [ ] TODO(P1): Define backend models: Account, Transaction, ImportSession (Transaction identity must be deterministic via strongKey)
  - document in `docs/developer/README.md` or similar
  - ensure frontend models align with backend expectations
  - consider adding TypeScript types/interfaces for these models in `src/types` and using them at ingestion boundaries
- [ ] TODO(P1): Document auth flows and user-scoped persistence in architecture docs
  - how `useAuthUser()` works, how it triggers rehydration of user-scoped stores
  - the user-scoped storage key format and rationale
  - any implications for development/testing (e.g. how to clear state, how to test multiple users)
  - consider adding a diagram to illustrate the auth lifecycle and storage scoping
- [ ] TODO(P1): Document the transaction import flow (staging, apply, undo) in architecture docs
  - how import sessions are modeled, how transactions are tagged with `importSessionId`
  - the user experience around staging/apply/undo
  - any edge cases or important details (e.g. time window for undo, how duplicates are prevented)
  - consider adding a flow diagram to illustrate the import process and state transitions

  - consider adding a diagram to illustrate the budgeting model and relationships between concepts
- [ ] TODO(P1): Document the decision to use a shared Amplify Gen 1 backend with AppSync GraphQL API
  - rationale for the decision (reuse backend services, decoupled frontend)
  - what resources are shared (user pool, GraphQL API) and what is separate (frontend codebase, auth handling, local persistence)
  - any implications for development or future plans (e.g. if we want to migrate to Gen 2 in the future, how would that work?)
- [ ] TODO(P1): Document the user personas and target users for Budgeteer in the architecture or roadmap docs
  - budget planner, spreadsheet migrator, developer/reviewer
  - how these personas influenced design decisions and feature prioritization
  - any plans for future features that might target additional personas (e.g. multi-user collaboration for households)
- [ ] TODO(P1): Document the non-goals for Budgeteer in the architecture or roadmap docs
  - Plaid/bank credential linking, automated “magic” budgeting, crypto/investing/net-worth features, multi-user household collaboration
  - rationale for excluding these features (out of scope, future possibility, etc.)
  - how we might approach these features in the future if we decide to pursue them
- [ ] TODO(P1): Document the product and engineering goals for Budgeteer in the architecture or roadmap docs
  - planning-first budgeting, safe imports, clarity, privacy-by-design, showcase-quality engineering
  - how these goals influenced design and implementation decisions
  - any trade-offs or challenges we faced in trying to achieve these goals
- [ ] TODO(P1): Ensure the architecture doc reflects the current system accurately
  - review and update sections on auth, persistence, budgeting model, transaction importing, etc. to match the current implementation
  - remove any outdated references to non-Budgeteer concepts
  - ensure the doc is clear and comprehensive for new developers joining the project

<a id="p2"></a>
### TODO(P2)

- [ ] TODO(P2): Imports — “Clear session” UX: offer advanced options (clear only import vs clear only tracker)
- [ ] TODO(P2): Imports — add a DEV-only variant of “Clear session” with extra scoping toggles for experimentation

## Review needed — possible intentional identifiers

- [ ] REVIEW: Amplify-generated auth/API identifiers still include `taskmaster` (do not rename unless you are rebuilding/updating the Amplify backend config)

<a id="p3"></a>
### TODO(P3)

- [ ] TODO(P3): Clean up migration leftovers in settings and “platform” pages
  - eliminate UI that only exists to support unrelated scaffolding flows
- [ ] TODO(P3): Reduce store surface area (without tackling `any` yet)
  - separate UI-only flags from budgeting domain state
  - ensure persist `partialize` is correct and minimal

- [ ] TODO(P3): Evaluate splitting slice modules into separate persisted stores once domains are stable (Milestone 2 stretch)
- [ ] TODO(P3): Page-by-page DRY sweep (refactor-only; no behavior changes)
  - [ ] extract shared helper functions (date/month-key math, formatting, common aggregations)
  - [ ] extract shared helper consts (chart defaults/dimensions, clamp lengths, common table column sets)
  - [ ] extract reusable Chakra wrappers only where it makes sense (similar to `DialogModal`, `AppCollapsible`, `AppSelect`, `AppTable`)
  - [ ] consider a reusable RadioGroup wrapper if multiple pages share the same pattern
  - [ ] consider a tiny Recharts wrapper to standardize `ResponsiveContainer` props (e.g. `initialDimension`, `minWidth`) and avoid reintroducing console warnings

  - define a single RootStore type (slice composition)
  - remove `set/get/store/state: any` in the persist wrapper
- [x] TODO(P3): Replace remaining `any` in `src/store/slices/plannerSlice.ts` (planner domain models + setters) (done 2026-02-19)
  - keep scope tight; don’t attempt to type unrelated UI
- [ ] TODO(P3): Tighten ingestion internal/output shapes (`analyzeImport` + `ImportPlan`)
  - replace `existingTxns: any[]` with domain `Transaction[]`
  - remove `parsedRows?: any` and `norm: any` by introducing narrow row/normalized-row types
- [ ] TODO(P3): Defer non-core `any` cleanup in utilities until after core ingestion work ships
  - `src/utils/analysisUtils.ts`, `src/utils/calcUtils.ts`, `src/utils/demoUtils.ts`

- [ ] TODO(P1): Implement read-only pull: fetch cloud Accounts/Transactions and hydrate Zustand safely
- [ ] TODO(P1): Implement outbox queue (local) for idempotent sync writes + retry
- [ ] TODO(P1): Wire Import Transactions + Sync Accounts apply flow to enqueue backend writes (ImportSession + Transactions) under SyncLock

- [ ] TODO(P2): Add ImportSession cloud status transitions (STAGED/APPLIED/UNDONE/EXPIRED) and mirror to UI import history
- [ ] TODO(P2): Add “initial upload” migration path: push existing local accounts/txns to cloud (one-time) with dedupe
- [ ] TODO(P2): Add basic conflict protection: detect remote newer data and warn before overwriting local
- [ ] TODO(P2): Add incremental pull (by updatedAt) to avoid downloading everything each sync
- [ ] TODO(P2): Add sync telemetry panel (last sync time, counts pushed/pulled, last error)

- [ ] TODO(P3): Move persisted data from localStorage blob to IndexedDB (optional) for scalability (transactions can get large)

<a id="stretch"></a>
### Stretch goals (deferred until post-MVP)

- [ ] TODO(stretch): Add true offline mode UX (sync badge + queued ops count + retry controls)
- [ ] TODO(stretch): Add fine-grained conflict UI (pick local vs remote per field)
- [ ] TODO(stretch): Add automated backups/export (cloud snapshot export)
- [ ] TODO(stretch): Imports/Tracker — detect recurring income streams from imported transactions and offer “Add as Planner income source(s)” to seed scenario planning (creates new income source tabs)
  - Suggestions: conservative detector (income-only; require >= 3–4 occurrences; amount consistency; show review list with checkbox per suggestion)
  - Gotchas: transfers can look like income; biweekly vs monthly math; avoid surprising “estimated monthly” conversions (prefer explicit frequency and show computed estimate)
- [ ] TODO(stretch): Tracker/Imports — add a row-level action “Promote to Planner income source” (safe MVP alternative to auto-detection)
  - Place: next to an actual income row in Tracker “Income Details” (and/or in Import session review), so the user can promote a known-good stream with one click
- [ ] TODO(stretch): Planner — add "weekly" and "bi-weekly" as income types/frequency options in IncomeSourceForm to reduce manual salary conversions
---

<a id="postmvp"></a>
### Post-MVP possibilities (deferred until core UX is stable and we have a better sense of user needs)

- [ ] TODO(postmvp): Evaluate double-entry ledger redesign only if transfer/reconciliation bugs dominate
- [ ] TODO(postmvp): Add OFX import + cloud sync integration
- [ ] TODO(postmvp): Add Plaid-based syncing (replace stub in src/utils/plaidService.js)
- [ ] TODO(postmvp): (Optional) Add Tier B (raw provenance) persistence for diagnostic/archive purposes
  - MUST be opt-in and explicit; default remains Tier A-only cloud sync
  - define retention/TTL + access policy; avoid shipping raw bank exports by default

### Platform / Foundations

- [x] `TODO`(P1): Decide Amplify Gen 2 vs Gen 1 (AppSync GraphQL) and record decision in docs/migration-plan.md
  - Decision: This app uses an Amplify Gen 1 backend with AppSync GraphQL API. Some backend resource identifiers still contain `taskmaster` naming (see the REVIEW items above); treat those as infrastructure identifiers unless/until you intentionally rebuild/rename the backend configuration. Budgeteer’s UI code is separate and focuses on budgeting features, with local persistence + GraphQL used primarily for UserProfile bootstrapping.
    
    This allows us to reuse backend services while keeping the new app decoupled and focused on budgeting features.

- [x] `TODO`(P1): Add Amplify backend with Cognito auth (Nick + Jr users, shared household access)
    - Amplify Gen 1 backend added with Cognito user pool and AppSync GraphQL API.
    - UserProfile table created in DynamoDB for storing user profiles.
    - Budgeteer can create users in the shared user pool and call existing GraphQL endpoints for user profile management.

### CSV ingestion + core budgeting flows

---

- [x] TODO(P2): Import History “Apply selected session” must be session-scoped (do not apply other sessions in same month)
  - add session-scoped store APIs (apply + pending savings) and wire Import History to use them
  - add regression tests for overlapping sessions
  - tracking doc: `docs/developer/ingestion-plan.md`

- [x] TODO(P3): Full ingestion refactor — ImportPlan + commit (done)
  - `analyzeImport(...) -> ImportPlan` (serializable plan; no function-valued patches)
  - `commitImportPlan(plan)` is the single store commit boundary for import UIs
  - tests cover analyze/commit determinism + idempotency
  - tracking doc: `docs/developer/ingestion-plan.md`

- [x] TODO(P4): Proposed ingestion upgrades (done)
  - enable PapaParse worker mode for streaming parse (large files)
  - add streaming backpressure/yielding for classify/infer stages
  - add memory/perf guardrails for huge imports
  - improve error panel scalability (render cap + export warning)

### UX polish + clarity
